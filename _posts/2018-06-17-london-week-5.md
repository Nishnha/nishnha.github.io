I was placed on a new big project this week!

I came into work on Tuesday after having issues with my flight back home from the Netherlands. Luckily, Michael had Okayed us to stay there until Monday; we were just trying to get back a day early!

Tuesday morning I had a normal workday-and I was so relieved! I have had a really crazy past two weeks and 
I was so happy to get back to a regular work day. I worked on the new LongFinance web page and got some of my personal tasks done as well. That included the blog posts from the previous two weeks!
I went to lunch with Fabio and Ian. It was the first time Ian and I met Fabio in London. We got Thai food (it wasn't that great) **but** on the way back Fabio showed us a small square with three restaurant stands! The food is fantastic--in fact, I went back for the next two days! There are a few options: falafel, haloumi, gryos, rice bowls, and salads.
 
On Wednesday I met with James--the director of Distributed Futures--to discuss our upcoming meeting with Lysander PR for Z/Yen's new membership venture. In the meeting I worked with James to decide on upcoming plans, work on new ideas, keep minutes, and to sign on Lysander PR officially. James dubbed me "The Lysander PR Intern". 

Wednesday night, the fire alarm went off for my building--at 3 am. I went into work a bit later than usual (I emailed and got an OK). Interestingly enough, it was the anniversary of the Grenfell tower fire. . . .
A firetruck showed up later for an evacuation and inspection.

Thursday and the start of the World Cup! We drew lots and placed bets at work and some nearby offices were streaming it on televisions! 
That day, James put Ian and me on a few new tasks, though including bringing some older Z/Yen records up-to-date and creating new content. I ended up creating a compilation booklet for all of Distributed Future's publications and designed the cover. I created an edit, online, and two print version (A3 and A4) of the booklet. It should be on the website soon so I can share a link! I also made the new use case webpage for ChainZy which is also part of the upcoming Long Finance publication (on cryptocurrency trade simulations).

I met up with some of the other interns after work on Friday at a local pub to watch the World Cup Portugal vs. Spain game.

On Saturday, Luke invited all the interns over to his place, Buckenham Palace. Nearly everyone showed up--it was the first time we've had so many of the interns together in the UK!

Luke made tacos and it was fantastic! We had music going as well, but later in the day we walked over to the nearby park and fields.

the only thing missing was Dalton, but I can't wait to hear about his time in Brussel!
We ended up leaving pretty late into the night--we spent so much time in the park and fields!
