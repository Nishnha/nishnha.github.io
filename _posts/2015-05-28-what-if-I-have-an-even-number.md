title: What If I Have an Even Number?

So what if I have an even number of articles? Does float actually work? I need to figure out what to do when I have an odd number of articles. Well, I guess when I get more than 10 that won't be a problem, but for right now it is. When I get more than 10 articles then the paginator tag won't display any more and so it'll be an even number on the left and right side (5 each), therefore, nothing will display in the middle... hopefully!
