This week was a big one for me at work: [Z/Yen released a report on Timestamping](http://www.zyen.com/what-we-do/mutual-distributed-ledgers/65-publications/1776-timestamping-smart-ledgers-comparable-universal-traceable-immune.html)!
The report took place on Wednesday morning and a had a fantastic turnout. This was a huge win for me personally, as well, since I helped edit the report!

Following the release, Ian and I went to another event at Amorour's Hall. The event was on legislation preparation for Brexit but the venue was gorgeous!

On Thursday we continued working on the new Z/Yen website, and following that, Ian and I went to a yacht party held by the Metro Chamber of Atlanta.

Michael didn't seem particularly interested in attending, and was only present for a few minutes. However, Luke, Dalton, Katherine, Ian, and myself took advantage of the open bar. . . Luke perhaps a bit too much!

***Amsterdam***

Perhaps you remember in my previous post [my drunken, tired banter](/posts/spain-london-week-3)? Well that brings us to the present.

From leaving the yacht to arriving in Amsterdam, I got no sleep. In fact, in that period of time I managed to drink 3 beers before going through airport security (since they would have confiscated them). Normally, I wouldn't include details like this in my post, but, hey, I'm going to Amsterdam! This is probably the most safe-for-work thing to share!

. . .

Skipping ahead a few days ahead, ahem, I ended up on a gorgeous beach on the west coast of the Netherlands, outside of the city itself.

The area was apparently a tourist destination for the Dutch, but hey, at least there aren't souvenir shops on ever street corner like Amsterdam!
