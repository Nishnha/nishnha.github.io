I was placed on a new big project this week!

I came into work on Tuesday after having issues with my flight back home from the Netherlands. Luckily, Michael had Okayed us to stay there until Monday; we were just trying to get back a day early!

Tuesday morning I had a normal workday-and I was so relieved! I have had a really crazy past two weeks and I was so happy to get back to a regular work day. I worked on the new LongFinance web page and got some of my personal tasks done as well (which included the blog posts from the previous two weeks).
I went to lunch with Fabio and Ian. It was the first time Ian and I met Fabio in London. We got Thai food (and it wasn't that great) **but** on the way back Fabio showed us a packed intersection with three Persian restaurant stands! The food is fantastic--in fact, I went back for the next two days! There are a few options: falafel, haloumi, gryos, rice bowls, and salads.
 
On Wednesday I met with James--the director of Distributed Futures--to discuss our upcoming meeting with Lysander PR for Z/Yen's new membership venture. In the meeting I worked with James to decide on upcoming plans, work on new ideas, keep minutes, and to sign on Lysander PR officially. James dubbed me "The Lysander PR Intern". 

I'm excited that I'm finally taking on more responsibility within the company. I feel like I can handle the workload that I was given and now that I'm moving on to bigger tasks I need to show Z/Yen and Michael that I can continue outputting the same quality of work that I was before.

Wednesday night, the fire alarm went off for my building--at 3 am. I went into work a bit later than usual (I emailed and got an OK). Interestingly enough, it was the anniversary of the Grenfell tower fire.... A firetruck showed up later for an evacuation and inspection.

With Thursday came the start of the World Cup! We drew lots and placed bets at work and some nearby offices were streaming it on television! 
That day, James put Ian and me on a few new tasks, though including bringing some older Z/Yen records up-to-date and creating new content. I ended up creating a compilation booklet for all of Distributed Future's publications and designed the cover. I created an edit, online, and two print version (A3 and A4) of the booklet. I also made the new use-case webpage for ChainZy which is also part of the upcoming Long Finance publication (on cryptocurrency trade simulations).

On Friday, I met up with some of the other interns at a local pub after work to watch the World Cup Portugal vs. Spain game.

On Saturday, Luke invited all the interns over to his place, Buckenham Palace. Nearly everyone showed up--it was the first time we've had so many of the interns together in the UK! We ate tacos, had music going, and later in the day we walked over to a nearby park and field.

Unfortuantely, Dalton was missing, but I can't wait to hear about his time in Brussel!
