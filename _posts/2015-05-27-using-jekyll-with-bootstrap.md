title: Using Jekyll With Bootstrap
layout: post
---

I wanted to make a blog. Simple enough - use google to find how to make one, right? I came across hundreds of solutions--WordPress, etc. etc.--and then I found Jekyll. It was perfect for anyone who wanted to make a blog, complex, sure, but flexible and powerful too. I knew a bit of HTML coding from past efforts and I watched a few videos on CSS styling. Here's another sentence as a test. I don't know what this will do, but I think it will do something that will help me figure out this madness!

My struggle began from installation. I would host with Github, that I had figured out, but Jekyll itself was an issue. What were all these files for?
