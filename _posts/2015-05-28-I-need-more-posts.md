So Jekyll might actually be the thing for me! Who knew? Now I need to steal some random junk from another blog so I can have some test sentences. I guess I'll use something from the boston globe since their navbar is what got me into web design! If I make this any longer will the website be fixed? I need to figure out how to get around this too because I can't keep making super long excerpts!

I have implement this example-site, it's not a real site, just an example, I did categories list in the right side of the site, they're actually pages, every one as one category (there was no used plugins for this).

I don't want use plugin for this, because all things like "related posts via tags", "every post categories linked to its categories page", and the other things I did without plugins, and so can write posts directly from github.
