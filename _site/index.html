            <p class="description">So what if I have an even number of articles? Does float actually work? I need to figure out what to do when I have an odd number of articles. Well, I guess when I get more than 10 that won’t be a problem, but for right now it is. When I get more than 10 articles then the paginator tag won’t display any more and so it’ll be an even number on the left and right side (5 each), therefore, nothing will display in the middle… hopefully!

            <p class="description">So Jekyll might actually be the thing for me! Who knew? Now I need to steal some random junk from another blog so I can have some test sentences. I guess I’ll use something from the boston globe since their navbar is what got me into web design! If I make this any longer will the website be fixed? I need to figure out how to get around this too because I can’t keep making super long excerpts!

            <p class="description">I wanted to make a blog. Simple enough - use google to find how to make one, right? I came across hundreds of solutions–WordPress, etc. etc.–and then I found Jekyll. It was perfect for anyone who wanted to make a blog, complex, sure, but flexible and powerful too. I knew a bit of HTML coding from past efforts and I watched a few videos on CSS styling. Here’s another sentence as a test. I don’t know what this will do, but I think it will do something that will help me figure out this madness!

            <p class="description">Lets say you’re the typical honors student (I suppose that’s safe to assume since you’re reading this blog), you work your butt off all year to get “good” grades to get into that “decent” college and then–what, get a job? join the workforce of hundreds of thousands of zombie-like adults who rise much too early and sleep far too late?
