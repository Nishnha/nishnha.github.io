            <p class="description">So what if I have an even number of articles? Does float actually work? I need to figure out what to do when I have an odd number of articles. Well, I guess when I get more than 10 that won’t be a problem, but for right now it is. When I get more than 10 articles then the paginator tag won’t display any more and so it’ll be an even number on the left and right side (5 each), therefore, nothing will display in the middle… hopefully!

            <p class="description">So Jekyll might actually be the thing for me! Who knew? Now I need to steal some random junk from another blog so I can have some test sentences. I guess I’ll use something from the boston globe since their navbar is what got me into web design! If I make this any longer will the website be fixed? I need to figure out how to get around this too because I can’t keep making super long excerpts!

            <p class="description">I wanted to make a blog. Simple enough - use google to find how to make one, right? I came across hundreds of solutions–WordPress, etc. etc.–and then I found Jekyll. It was perfect for anyone who wanted to make a blog, complex, sure, but flexible and powerful too. I knew a bit of HTML coding from past efforts and I watched a few videos on CSS styling. Here’s another sentence as a test. I don’t know what this will do, but I think it will do something that will help me figure out this madness!

I’ve read a lot about VM design and I’m into stuff like OS design, programming languages and other seeminlgy obscure and nerdy stuff surrounding the concept of a computer as a generic tool.

            <p class="description">Hue is one of my latest hobby projects that didn’t die after a week. It’s a functional programming language, in a sense. There are no statements in this language, but everything is an expression. An expression does something funky and returns something—hopefully—even funkier. That includes if..then..else as well as logical tests and functions.

            <p class="description">A few months back I wrote a programming language called Move. Before the advent of Move, JavaScript (on Node.js) was my universal language of choice. Two years earlier it was Python. During the last four months I have basically been exclusive with Move – quick hacks, data mangling scripts, network services, websites, iphone apps… you name it. What initially was a fun week of language research and interviews with people, turned into a very usable programming language and library.

            <p class="description">Fellow designer Jordi Parra recently finished his masters degree project “Spotify box” — a beautiful little radio-like device which plays music through the Spotify platform. What’s really neat about Jordi’s Spotify box—except from its gorgeous design—is that it brings back the physical interaction with music as an object, but adjusted to the 21st century. A playable item is represented by a small token, conveying a link by wireless RFID technology.
