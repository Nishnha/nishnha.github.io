I knew a bit of HTML coding from past efforts and I watched a few videos on CSS styling. Here’s another sentence as a test. I don’t know what this will do, but I think it will do something that will help me figure out this madness!

What initially was a fun week of language research and interviews with people, turned into a very usable programming language and library.

A playable item is represented by a small token, conveying a link by wireless RFID technology.
