Well, I guess when I get more than 10 that won’t be a problem, but for right now it is. When I get more than 10 articles then the paginator tag won’t display any more and so it’ll be an even number on the left and right side (5 each), therefore, nothing will display in the middle… hopefully!

I came across hundreds of solutions–WordPress, etc. etc.–and then I found Jekyll. It was perfect for anyone who wanted to make a blog, complex, sure, but flexible and powerful too. I knew a bit of HTML coding from past efforts and I watched a few videos on CSS styling. Here’s another sentence as a test. I don’t know what this will do, but I think it will do something that will help me figure out this madness!

There are no statements in this language, but everything is an expression. An expression does something funky and returns something—hopefully—even funkier. That includes if..then..else as well as logical tests and functions.

Two years earlier it was Python. During the last four months I have basically been exclusive with Move – quick hacks, data mangling scripts, network services, websites, iphone apps… you name it. What initially was a fun week of language research and interviews with people, turned into a very usable programming language and library.

What’s really neat about Jordi’s Spotify box—except from its gorgeous design—is that it brings back the physical interaction with music as an object, but adjusted to the 21st century. A playable item is represented by a small token, conveying a link by wireless RFID technology.
