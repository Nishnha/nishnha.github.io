	<div><p>I went to a carshow this weekend!</p>

<p>Otherwise, this was a pretty standard work week.</p>

<p>I continued working on the project that Michael assigned me to throughout the week and had another meeting with Lysander PR on Wednesday. Michael also asked me to write a blog post on a product called What3Words. Z/Yen has a project that is like W3W so I’m writing a piece comparing and contrasting the two. Additionally, I helped Michael with his Aldermancy campaign.</p>

<p>Most of the office has been preparing for our new report coming out on 25 July titled “Smart Ledgers &amp; Collective Defined Contribution Pensions.” This is the first report that I haven’t worked on before its release, so I’m excited to attend the report launch and read it.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1847068678659108/">The car show</a> was literally in the middle of Sloan Street, London. The streets are lined with high-end designer stores.</p>
