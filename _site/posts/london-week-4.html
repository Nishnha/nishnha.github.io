	<div><p>This week was a big one for me at work: <a href="http://www.zyen.com/what-we-do/mutual-distributed-ledgers/65-publications/1776-timestamping-smart-ledgers-comparable-universal-traceable-immune.html">Z/Yen released a report on Timestamping</a>!
The report took place on Wednesday morning and a had a fantastic turnout. This was a huge win for me personally, as well, since I helped edit the report!</p>

<p>Following the release, Ian and I went to another event at Amorour’s Hall. The event was on legislation preparation for Brexit but the venue was gorgeous!</p>

<p>On Thursday we continued working on the new Z/Yen website, and following that, Ian and I went to a yacht party held by the Metro Chamber of Atlanta.</p>

<p>Michael didn’t seem particularly interested in attending, and was only present for a few minutes. However, Luke, Dalton, Katherine, Ian, and myself had much fun!</p>

<p><strong><em>Amsterdam</em></strong></p>

<p>Perhaps you remember in my previous post <a href="/posts/spain-london-week-3">my drunken, tired banter</a>? Well that brings us to the present.</p>

<p>From leaving the yacht to arriving in Amsterdam, I got no sleep.</p>

<p>. . .</p>

<p>I ended up on a gorgeous beach on the west coast of the Netherlands, outside of the city itself.</p>

<p>The area was apparently a tourist destination for the Dutch, but hey, at least there aren’t souvenir shops on ever street corner like Amsterdam!</p>

<p>Below: A market I ran into in the town I was staying in.
