	<div><p>This week was the first regular work week I’ve had in a while!</p>

<p>On Monday, Z/Yen hired a new intern named Yining!
And since Michael and James have been drowning in work this week, Ian and I were sort of put in charge of showing Yining the ropes. It felt a little odd showing around someone new when I’ve only been here eight weeks myself!
After work, Michael took all of us interns to the Little Boat Club to attend the annual Master’s event for the Worshipful Company of World Traders. At the event we met many of the London-based World Traders and heard stories about how they started out. It was a great event to meet new people and form connections, so I’m very thankful that Michael took us there!</p>

<p>Tuesday, I continued working on the double pagers for Distributed Futures reports.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Z/Yen had a report launch for one of our newer Long Finance projects, The Eternal Coin. Following the report launch we had a brief team meeting and were tasked with making a brochure for The Eternal Coin like that of the Distributed Futures brochure Luke worked on last year. I also started working on another fun little project, MetroTono, which takes GeoGnomo coordinates and converts them to a short musical composition.</p>

<p>Thursday was a particularly fun day this week because of the City of London BeerFest! The event took place in the Guild Hall courtyard and had dozens of breweries to try from (and a few food stalls), and there was live music! 
I also got a lot done at work on Thursday. I worked with Yining to create a double-pager for the new report, helped Michael out with some of his Aldermancy tasks, and led an meeting with Lysander PR. 
Friday was similar to Thursday in that I continued working on the same tasks, but I went to Assenheim 56 for lunch with most of the team. It was a fun outting!</p>
