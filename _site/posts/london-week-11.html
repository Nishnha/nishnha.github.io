	<div><p>I went to Lords (cricket) with the Z/Yen team and to Wales with Ben and Dalton this week!</p>

<p>Not too much happened on Monday, but on Tuesday Ian and I were tasked with picking up the reports from the shipping centre (and dropping off some items for the launch). So, we took a 30 minute Uber to the pick-up point which was south of the Thames. Upon arrival, we had to put on reflective vests (see below), but it turns out that the reports had already been sent out!</p>

<p>Wednesday morning was the report launch! Luckily, it went smoothly without any issues (and we filled out all the seats in the venue, Bernard’s Inn Hall!). Michael also showed us the museum room in the basement where there was a tablecloth that had been specially made by Thomas Gresham for Queen Victoria’s visit (and cost nearly 100,000 pounds to produce!). We also saw the foundation that the building was built on top of–part of which was Roman.</p>

<p>Also on Wednesday, James, the director for Distributed Futures came back from vacation and had quite a few stories to tell. Turns out, some of the football teams went to the same area he did following the world cup. We also had a meeting with Lysander PR in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Thursday was the day Z/Yen went to Lords! Not too much happened in the morning, but around 16:30 we all took the tube down to Brick Lane Station and walked to the stadium. Unfortunately, it was way too hot out and I did not bring a change of clothes, and I was carying way too much stuff.
Anyhow, the cricket match was T-20, so it was only 4 hours long as opposed to some of the multi-day matches–and we had dim sum (and lots of it)! This was my first live cricket match, and it seemed to be the European equivilent of baseball, but I really enjoyed the whole experience!</p>

<p>Friday was the last day Ian and I would see Michael as he would be going off to vacation and will return after we leave. It was an especially busy day for me since I was trying to complete as many of the projects that he had assigned me as possible before he headed out. We also had a final performance review with him, and at the end of it, <strong>he offered Ian and me positions at Z/Yen should we come back!</strong></p>

<p>Ben, Dalton and I went on a roadtrip to some of the costal regions of Wales. We also stopped in Bristol.

<p>We had a fantastic meal in a small town, Pembrooke, and saw plenty of castles all across Wales.

<p>We also stopped at a few beaches. We managed to catch one at low tide an walk quite a ways into the beach!</p>
