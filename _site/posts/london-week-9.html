	<div><p>I went to the House of Lords this week!</p>

<p>After meeting Baroness Sue Garden at the Little Boat Club, which Michael took us interns to the previous week, she had reached out to Michael and invited us all to a luncheon! She was very kind to lead us interns, Linda, and Elisabeth around Parliament and telling us about the history of the building. Lady Garden also invited us to watch two new Lords be inducted. Unfortunately, I don’t have any pictures to share since photography is banned in the House of Lords. This is doubly-misfortunate since the lunch was plated beautifully!</p>

<p>Also, Alexandra and Ben–having just gotten married–came back to work on Monday. They too have no pictures to share since the photographer is still editing the pictures!</p>

<p>On Tuesday I attended an event at PwC and met up with Dalton and Kat. The event, CSFI’s Brussels in Breakfast, is both informative and interesting since it takes the format of a panel discussion where the only rules are the Chattam House rules. I also worked on the “new” Z/Yen homepage, which looks quite similar to the old one. . . .</p>

<p>The remainder of the week, I continued working on the previous projects I’ve discussed, and Michael assigned me to a new, exciting project too. I can’t disclose any of the details of the project, but it’s for sure the biggest one yet in terms of scale, responsibility, and future impact that I’ve seen in the company.</p>
