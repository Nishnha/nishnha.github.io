	<div><p>I went to Scotland this weekend!</p>

<p>My parents left to go back to the US on Tuesday, so I went with my sister, Neha, to Edinburgh and Glasgow on a night-bus.</p>

<p>But before I get too into my weekend travels, a work update:</p>

<p>I’ve been placed in charge of Z/Yen’s social media inititive and have been meeting with the social media firm, Lysander PR, quite a bit in order to promote Z/Yen’s upcoming events and new annual event on 9 October 2018.</p>

<p>With that, Michael has asked both Ian and me to help him with <em>his</em> social media!</p>

<p>Another project Ian and I were put on is GFCI (Global Financial Centres Index) 24. We’re tasked with finding and compiling any changes in the indices GFCI depends on.</p>

<p>On Wednesday Z/Yen held a workshop on Smart Cities and we were asked to give our honest input on the meeting. I feel like Michael is starting to trust Ian and me with more responsibilities (perhaps more than some of the other employees!). He’s starting to take us to more events too–on Tuesday he brought us to an insurance report launch at Cass Business School.</p>

<p>We also had a fun little treat at the office on Friday since it was so hot–ice cream!</p>

<hr />

<p>Scotland was AMAZING.</p>

A view from Arthur’s seat, the highest point in Edinburgh!</p>

<p>Honestly, I’ve taken too many pictures to include on just one blog post.
Edinburgh had some really great views, making it an ideal adventure trip. Meanwhile, Glasgow was an active city (especially at night), so it was really great to spend time in both cities.</p>

The Cathedral in Glasgow (and right behind it was a mausoleum).</p>

<p>I’m considering going back in a few weeks with the other interns who are planning a trip there!</p>
