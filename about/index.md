Hi, my name is Nish and I am a software engineer and autodidact. I've been lucky enough to travel extensively across North America and Europe, and somewhat across Asia. My hobbies include acoustic guitar, mechanics, electronics, rock climbing, and music. I am very comfortable working in Linux and use [Arch](https://www.github.com/nishnha/arch-config) on my laptop (an XPS 9350) and Windows 10 on my desktop (mainly for gaming). 

Previously, I co-founded a startup and worked as the lead software engineer. I have also held software engineering internships at The Home Depot (OrangeWorks), GE Digital, GE Power, and NCR. I also did a gig as a fintech consultant at a company based in London. If you'd like to know more about my past work experience you can download my [resume]("/res/Nishant Sinha Resume.pdf") or my [CV]("/res/Nishant Sinha CV.pdf").

While I enjoy software engineering, I have strong interests in chemistry and physics. I was once a chemistry teacher assistant and twice a computer science teacher assistant. Interestingly enough, I have a slight dislike towards biology.
