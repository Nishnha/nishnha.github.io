Hi, my name is Nish and I am a software engineer and autodidact. I've been lucky enough to travel extensively across North America and Europe, and somewhat across Asia. My hobbies include acoustic guitar, mechanics, electronics, rock climbing, and music. I am very comfortable working in Linux and use [Arch](https://www.github.com/nishnha/arch-config) on my laptop (an XPS 9350) and Windows 10 on my desktop (mainly for gaming). 

Previously, I co-founded a startup and worked as the lead software engineer. I have also held software engineering internships at The Home Depot (OrangeWorks), GE Digital, GE Power, and NCR. I also did a gig as a fintech consultant at a company based in London. If you'd like to know more about my past work experience you can download my [resume]("/res/Nishant Sinha Resume.pdf") or my [CV]("/res/Nishant Sinha CV.pdf").

While I enjoy software engineering, I have strong interests in chemistry and physics. I was once a chemistry teacher assistant (and twice a computer science teacher assistant). Interestingly enough, I have a slight dislike towards biology--perhaps because of the amount of rote memorization.

| üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è | Move with urgency, focus, and perseverance |
| --- | --- |
|| We care more about results than process but we also question when things can be better and identify opportunities for improvement. When we find better solutions, we quickly implement them sooner than later to maximize long term results. When we work, we focus on the task instead of getting caught up in the bureaucracy of management and check-lists. We set expectations and deadlines over creating project milestones, and we reach out to each other when we need help instead of waiting. In tough situations we persevere through research and discovery and we hold on to our beliefs because we know persistence is key. |

| üß† | Be open minded and ask for feedback |
| --- | --- |
|| We have a blend of different backgrounds on our teams, and we acknowledge our differences to work past them. We embrace experiencing new cultures because it allows us to understand different perspectives and the world from someone else's view. When someone speaks to our character, we say "thank you." We create feedback loops to know where we made mistakes and where we can improve in our interactions and our work. We scrutinize each other's work and give meaningful feedback, but remain optimistic about the final outcome. Or as Stripe puts it, we're micro pessimists but macro optimists. Our willingness to learn from each other is what keeps us motivated and working together as a team. |

| üë®‚Äçüîß | Stay innovative |

|| We are comfortable breaking traditions and pioneering new approaches. We have the ability to quickly learn and adapt to new tools and platforms. We push boundaries to make things an order of magnitude better than the current solution. We look forward to disrupting the status quo. |
